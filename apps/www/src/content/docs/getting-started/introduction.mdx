## Overview

This documentation covers components created with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Each component is designed to be highly customizable and straightforward to integrate. You will find detailed information on usage, properties, and API references for each component.

## Introduction

Our component collection aims to simplify your development workflow by offering a set of aesthetically pleasing and functional UI components. These pre-designed, production-ready components can be effortlessly integrated into your projects, saving you time and effort.

## Before You Begin

Ensure your project has a Tailwind CSS setup that aligns with or extends the default theme configuration. This project relies on Tailwind's default spacing scale, color palette, and other settings, which are crucial for the proper functioning and display of the components. Customizing these settings is possible, but significant changes might require you to make additional adjustments to the components.

## Setup

Refer to the [Installation](/docs/guides/nextjs-app) guide for detailed instructions on how to incorporate these components into your project. The guide includes steps for importing the necessary font family and configuring Tailwind CSS.
